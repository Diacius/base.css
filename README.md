# `base.css`
## It's a stylesheet that changes as little as it can, but makes HTML look **fabulous**
base.css is designed to be as small and easy to modify, but share any changes you make. 

If you want something that styles the page more - try **basecss-themes** - coming soon!.

Yes, it's probably yet another CSS reset, but I wanted to do things differently :D
