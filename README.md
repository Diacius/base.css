# `base.css`
## It's a stylesheet that changes as little as it can, but makes HTML look **fabulous**
base.css is designed to be as small and easy to modify, but share any changes you make. 

If you want something that styles the page more - try [themes](https://github.com/Diacius/base.css/tree/main/basecss-themes).

Yes, it's probably yet another CSS reset, but I wanted to do things differently :D

## IMPORTANT!! Expected HTML
**To make the page appear properly, structure your HTML like this**!
```html
<html>
<!-- Other tags -->
  <body>
    <div class="body-container">
      <main>
        <!-- Page content -->
      </main>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```
I recommend you use the `html:5` boilerplate in Emmet (which is in VSCode and Atom)
